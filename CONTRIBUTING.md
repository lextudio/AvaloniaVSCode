   You can get Node.js and npm using NVM (Node Version Manager) by running the following command:

    ```bash
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash

## Set up

1. Fork and Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/lextudio/vscode-axaml
    ```

2. Update submodules  
This extension uses git submodules to pull in the Solution Parser and the AXAML Visual Studio repo. Run the following to pull in the submodules:

    ``` bash
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```

## How to contribute

1. Create a new issue or use the existing to contribute (assign it yourself)
2. Create a new branch for the issue
3. Send the PR with description

## Run and Debug

Hit `F5` this will a new vscode window with the dev extension running. Open an Avalonia project to use it.

## Package Extension

Ensure you have `vsce` installed:

```bash
npm install -g @vscode/vsce
```

Build & package (outputs VSIX under ./output):

```bash
./package.sh
```

Or specify a custom output directory:

```bash
./package.sh /path/to/out
```

The script will:

- Copy the root README and LICENSE into `src/vscode-axaml` temporarily
- Build the language server (Release) & solution parser
- Compile the TypeScript client
- Run `vsce package` and place the .vsix in the output folder
- Remove the temporary README / LICENSE copies from the extension folder
